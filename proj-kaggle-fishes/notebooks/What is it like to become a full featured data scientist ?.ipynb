    "Two freshly recruited data scientists who knows how to code, have a fair understanding of statistics and the constrains of real life data project. Both of us have an affinity with unix environments, experience in python programming language and a geek culture to use shell tools to automatize tasks. Another common characteristic is that we both have a PhD in quantitative disciple. During this experience, we carry out our own research project with autonomy and perseverance in order to obtain original results. In addition, we have acquired transversal skills in written and oral communication, but also in project and time management. What we knew when we started.... (add points about what we learned in terms of project management during the phd ?)\n",

    "On the definition of data scientist. Data scientist can have a rather broad definition. In our view it is someone who can handle a data oriented project in its entirety. It should comprise the overlapping of three distinct domains: the skills of a statistician who knows how to model and summarize datasets; the skills of a computer scientist who can design and use algorithms to efficiently store, process, and visualize this data; and the scientific regard to ask the right questions and to put their answers in context. Most common tasks of a data scientist include project conception, tidying and exploring raw data, develop meaningful analysis, extract knowledge and information and communication an interesting and informative story. (This includes but is not limited to : project conception, data exploration/prep, developping meaningful analysis, extract knowledge not only information...) \n",

    "We took a kaggle competition as a trial project to help us acquire an experience in real world data issues. The objective of this competition is to contribute to fisheries monitoring by finding the best algorithm classifying into seven species of pictures catched from fishing boats. For more details about the rules, please refer to [kaggle website](https://www.kaggle.com/c/the-nature-conservancy-fisheries-monitoring).\n",
    "\n",
    "A consequence of the competition NDA, we can not share the pictures. The training dataset is divided in different categories with several annotated species with two extra classes : no fishes or other (whales, ...). The pictures are wide field shots from the several boats encompassing variations such as : day/night, multiplicity of fishes per picture, large fields of boat features,...\n",

    "It is one thing to use softwares such as Photoshop (Adobe), or The Gimp, quite an other to think about images as matrices and how you can extract meaningful features from them. A few libraries exists to work with images, two major attracted our interest with the constrain that we essentially work with Python : [Scikit Image](http://scikit-image.org/) and [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/). We started to test quite a few things that one can do with an image with a naive perspective : color coding and their advantages, thresholding, segmentations, transformations, detection of interest points (SIFT, SURF, ORB, hessian of gaussian, laplacian of gaussian, ..) and probably a few forgotten ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our hands even if scikit image was maybe a bit more intuitive with a very pythonic approach, OpenCV was much more stable and faster on operations such as color segmentation. There is only one counter intuitive hiccup which is that by default, OpenCV works with BGR color space and not RGB for it seems [historical reasons](https://www.learnopencv.com/why-does-opencv-use-bgr-color-format/)."
