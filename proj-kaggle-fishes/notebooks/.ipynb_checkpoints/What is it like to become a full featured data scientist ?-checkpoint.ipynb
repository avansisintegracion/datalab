    "Two freshly recruited data scientists who knows how to code, have a fair understanding of statistics and the constrains of real life data project. Both of us have an affinity with unix environments, experience in python programming language and a geek culture to use shell tools to automatize tasks. Another common characteristic is that we both have a PhD in quantitative disciple. During this experience, we carry out our own research project with autonomy and perseverance in order to obtain original results. In addition, we have acquired transversal skills in written and oral communication, but also in project and time management. What we knew when we started.... (add points about what we learned in terms of project management during the phd ?)\n",

    "On the definition of data scientist. Data scientist can have a rather broad definition. In our view it is someone who can handle a data oriented project in its entirety. It should comprise the overlapping of three distinct domains: the skills of a statistician who knows how to model and summarize datasets; the skills of a computer scientist who can design and use algorithms to efficiently store, process, and visualize this data; and the scientific regard to ask the right questions and to put their answers in context. Most common tasks of a data scientist include project conception, tidying and exploring raw data, develop meaningful analysis, extract knowledge and information and communication an interesting and informative story. (This includes but is not limited to : project conception, data exploration/prep, developping meaningful analysis, extract knowledge not only information...) \n",
